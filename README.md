Title: BOARDEASE: A Boarding House Management System with Email Notification
Description: BoardEase is a digital system that replaces the old paper-based way of managing boarding houses. It gives landlords one easy-to-use dashboard where they can manage tenants, rooms, and rental payments.
The system automatically sends email reminders for due or late payments, tracks payments in real time, and lets landlords filter data for financial reviews. They can also create detailed reports for monthly, quarterly, or yearly use.
With visual charts, landlords can quickly see tenant distribution and finances. Security is built in with Laravel Breeze login protection and encrypted tenant and payment data. Overall, BoardEase saves time, reduces mistakes, and helps landlords plan better for the future.
