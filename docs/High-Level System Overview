3. Data Flow Summary
The flow of information within the BoardEase system begins when the landlord inputs house and room information, which is stored in the Room Records database.
Tenants provide their details, which are stored in the Tenant Records database, and they also submit payment information, which is processed and saved in the Payment Records database.
In return, tenants receive a payment receipt as confirmation. The system then generates payment summaries and detailed financial reports for landlords, covering monthly, quarterly, and annual periods.
Additionally, payment details are sent to the Email Notifications module, which issues automated reminders to tenants about due or overdue balances via the Google Email API. 
All notifications are stored in the Notification Logs database for tracking.
